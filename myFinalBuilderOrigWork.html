        <h2 style="background-color:lavender">About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an undergraduate senior studying Public Health-Global Health and Biology at the University of Washington (UW). I am passionate about public health, population health, and health equity. Upon graduation, I am intending to pursue a Master of Public Health degree.</p>
        <p>Outside of my academics, I am volunteering as a Washington State Co-Lead for TeleHealth Access for Seniors - an entirely student-led 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that collects and donates video-enabled devices to community health clinics and VA hospitals for patients in need. I am also serving as a Scholar Lead for the Washington State Opportunity Scholarship where I mentor and support BIPOC, socioeconomic disadvantaged, and first-generation college students in navigating college. Moreover, I am part of the leadership team of Unite UW - an on-campus cultural exchange program that builds bridges between domestic and international students.</p>
